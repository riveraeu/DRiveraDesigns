    "text": "Here’s where the fun begins. This is the time to explore what might be. I like sketching ideas to get to the most efficient space plan. This plan needs to address the owners needs and be both practical and beautiful. Technical drawings are next. These drawings convey to the client and to the building department the scope of work and how this work differs from the existing conditions.Once approved by the client, theses drawings are formatted to comply with the applicable rules and requirements of the local building department. The selection of all finishes, fixtures, fittings, flooring tile, cabinets, countertops and plumbing are also part of the planning process. The working drawings and the specified finishes are required to complete a viable contract with the General Contractor. It is in the interest of the client that as many items as possible be quantified and listed in the contract.",

    "text": "The day has arrived and construction begins. I like to work with the Contractor’s designated project manager to set up the protocol for communication between the construction team, the home owners, and the design team. Site rules such as job site cleanliness, noise, parking and respect for neighbors need to be clear and posted in many cases. Many items specified have long lead times (such as cabinets, doors and windows, etc) These item should be ordered in a timely fashion so their arrival is in sync with the contractor’s schedule. Remember that the Contractor has received all the working documents and specification for the job, any questions by workers on site need to be conveyed to the contractor or design team for proper clarification. I make periodic job site visits as well as attend schedule job site meeting between the client and contractor. My job is to act on behalf of the client, as their agent, to ensure that the agreed upon work is performed as specified and described in construction documents.",

At this time the furniture’s arrival and delivery is coordinated, and the installation date is set. The installation date provides for the placing of all area rugs and pads, the locating and placement of all furniture, and the completion of window treatments and the hanging of all art work by the design team.",
